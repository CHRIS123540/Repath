PMD Threads
===========

Poll Mode Driver (PMD) threads are the threads that do the heavy lifting for
userspace switching.  They perform tasks such as continuous polling of
input ports for packets, classifying packets once received, and executing
actions on the packets once they are classified.

PMD threads utilize Receive (Rx) and Transmit (Tx) queues, commonly known as
*rxq*\s and *txq*\s to receive and send packets from/to an interface.

- For physical interfaces, the number of Tx Queues is automatically configured
  based on the number of PMD thread cores. The number of Rx queues can be
  configured with::

        $ ovs-vsctl set Interface <interface_name> options:n_rxq=N

- For virtual interfaces, the number of Tx and Rx queues are configured by
  libvirt/QEMU and enabled/disabled in the guest. Refer to :doc:'vhost-user'
  for more information.

The :program:`ovs-appctl` utility provides a number of commands for
querying PMD threads and their respective queues. This, and all of the above,
is discussed here.

.. todo::

   Add an overview of Tx queues including numbers created, how they relate to
   PMD threads, etc.

PMD Thread Statistics
---------------------

To show current stats::

    $ ovs-appctl dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-show

or::

    $ ovs-appctl dpif-netdev/pmd-perf-show

Detailed performance metrics for ``pmd-perf-show`` can also be enabled::

    $ ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . other_config:pmd-perf-metrics=true

See the `ovs-vswitchd(8)`_ manpage for more information.

To clear previous stats::

    $ ovs-appctl dpif-netdev/pmd-stats-clear

.. note::

    PMD stats are cumulative so they should be cleared in order to see how the
    PMDs are being used with current traffic.

Port/Rx Queue Assignment to PMD Threads
---------------------------------------

.. todo::

   This needs a more detailed overview of *why* this should be done, along with
   the impact on things like NUMA affinity.

Correct configuration of PMD threads and the Rx queues they utilize is a
requirement in order to achieve maximum performance. This is particularly true
for enabling things like multiqueue for :ref:`physical <dpdk-phy-multiqueue>`
and :ref:`vhost-user <dpdk-vhost-user>` interfaces.

Rx queues will be assigned to PMD threads by OVS, or they can be manually
pinned to PMD threads by the user.

To see the port/Rx queue assignment and current measured usage history of PMD
core cycles for each Rx queue::

    $ ovs-appctl dpif-netdev/pmd-rxq-show

.. note::

   A history of one minute is recorded and shown for each Rx queue to allow for
   traffic pattern spikes. Any changes in the Rx queue's PMD core cycles usage,
   due to traffic pattern or reconfig changes, will take one minute to be fully
   reflected in the stats.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.6.0

      The ``pmd-rxq-show`` command was added in OVS 2.6.0.

.. versionchanged:: 2.16.0

   A ``overhead`` statistics is shown per PMD: it represents the number of
   cycles inherently consumed by the OVS PMD processing loop.

Rx queue to PMD assignment takes place whenever there are configuration changes
or can be triggered by using::

    $ ovs-appctl dpif-netdev/pmd-rxq-rebalance

.. versionchanged:: 2.9.0

   Utilization-based allocation of Rx queues to PMDs and the
   ``pmd-rxq-rebalance`` command were added in OVS 2.9.0. Prior to this,
   allocation was round-robin and processing cycles were not taken into
   consideration.

   In addition, the output of ``pmd-rxq-show`` was modified to include
   Rx queue utilization of the PMD as a percentage.

Port/Rx Queue assignment to PMD threads by manual pinning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rx queues may be manually pinned to cores. This will change the default Rx
queue assignment to PMD threads::

    $ ovs-vsctl set Interface <iface> \
        other_config:pmd-rxq-affinity=<rxq-affinity-list>

where:

- ``<rxq-affinity-list>`` is a CSV list of ``<queue-id>:<core-id>`` values

For example::

    $ ovs-vsctl set interface dpdk-p0 options:n_rxq=4 \
        other_config:pmd-rxq-affinity="0:3,1:7,3:8"

This will ensure there are *4* Rx queues for dpdk-p0 and that these queues are
configured like so:

- Queue #0 pinned to core 3
- Queue #1 pinned to core 7
- Queue #2 not pinned
- Queue #3 pinned to core 8

PMD threads on cores where Rx queues are *pinned* will become *isolated* by
default. This means that these threads will only poll the *pinned* Rx queues.

If using ``pmd-rxq-assign=group`` PMD threads with *pinned* Rxqs can be
*non-isolated* by setting::

  $ ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . other_config:pmd-rxq-isolate=false

.. warning::

   If there are no *non-isolated* PMD threads, *non-pinned* RX queues will not
   be polled. If the provided ``<core-id>`` is not available (e.g. the
   ``<core-id>`` is not in ``pmd-cpu-mask``), the RX queue will be assigned to
   a *non-isolated* PMD, that will remain *non-isolated*.

Automatic Port/Rx Queue assignment to PMD threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If ``pmd-rxq-affinity`` is not set for Rx queues, they will be assigned to PMDs
(cores) automatically.

The algorithm used to automatically assign Rxqs to PMDs can be set by::

    $ ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . other_config:pmd-rxq-assign=<assignment>

By default, ``cycles`` assignment is used where the Rxqs will be ordered by
their measured processing cycles, and then be evenly assigned in descending
order to PMDs. The PMD that will be selected for a given Rxq will be the next
one in alternating ascending/descending order based on core id. For example,
where there are five Rx queues and three cores - 3, 7, and 8 - available and
the measured usage of core cycles per Rx queue over the last interval is seen
to be:

- Queue #0: 30%
- Queue #1: 80%
- Queue #3: 60%
- Queue #4: 70%
- Queue #5: 10%

The Rx queues will be assigned to the cores in the following order::

    Core 3: Q1 (80%) |
    Core 7: Q4 (70%) | Q5 (10%)
    Core 8: Q3 (60%) | Q0 (30%)

``group`` assignment is similar to ``cycles`` in that the Rxqs will be
ordered by their measured processing cycles before being assigned to PMDs.
It differs from ``cycles`` in that it uses a running estimate of the cycles
that will be on each PMD to select the PMD with the lowest load for each Rxq.

This means that there can be a group of low traffic Rxqs on one PMD, while a
high traffic Rxq may have a PMD to itself. Where ``cycles`` kept as close to
the same number of Rxqs per PMD as possible, with ``group`` this restriction is
removed for a better balance of the workload across PMDs.

For example, where there are five Rx queues and three cores - 3, 7, and 8 -
available and the measured usage of core cycles per Rx queue over the last
interval is seen to be:

- Queue #0: 10%
- Queue #1: 80%
- Queue #3: 50%
- Queue #4: 70%
- Queue #5: 10%

The Rx queues will be assigned to the cores in the following order::

    Core 3: Q1 (80%) |
    Core 7: Q4 (70%) |
    Core 8: Q3 (50%) | Q0 (10%) | Q5 (10%)

Alternatively, ``roundrobin`` assignment can be used, where the Rxqs are
assigned to PMDs in a round-robin fashion. This algorithm was used by
default prior to OVS 2.9. For example, given the following ports and queues:

- Port #0 Queue #0 (P0Q0)
- Port #0 Queue #1 (P0Q1)
- Port #1 Queue #0 (P1Q0)
- Port #1 Queue #1 (P1Q1)
- Port #1 Queue #2 (P1Q2)

The Rx queues may be assigned to the cores in the following order::

    Core 3: P0Q0 | P1Q1
    Core 7: P0Q1 | P1Q2
    Core 8: P1Q0 |

PMD Automatic Load Balance
--------------------------

Cycle or utilization based allocation of Rx queues to PMDs is done to give an
efficient load distribution based at the time of assignment. However, over time
it may become less efficient due to changes in traffic. This may cause an
uneven load among the PMDs, which in the worst case may result in packet drops
and lower throughput.

To address this, automatic load balancing of PMDs can be enabled by::

    $ ovs-vsctl set open_vswitch . other_config:pmd-auto-lb="true"

The following are minimum configuration pre-requisites needed for PMD Auto
Load Balancing to operate:

1. ``pmd-auto-lb`` is enabled.
2. ``cycle`` (default) or ``group`` based Rx queue assignment is selected.
3. There are two or more non-isolated PMDs present.
4. At least one non-isolated PMD is polling more than one Rx queue.

When PMD Auto Load Balance is enabled, a PMD core's CPU utilization percentage
is measured. The PMD is considered above the threshold if that percentage
utilization is greater than the load threshold every 10 secs for 1 minute.

The load threshold can be set by the user. For example, to set the load
threshold to 70% utilization of a PMD core::

    $ ovs-vsctl set open_vswitch .\
        other_config:pmd-auto-lb-load-threshold="70"

If not set, the default load threshold is 95%.

If a PMD core is detected to be above the load threshold and the minimum
pre-requisites are met, a dry-run using the current PMD assignment algorithm is
performed.

The current variance of load between the PMD cores and estimated variance from
the dry-run are both calculated. If the estimated dry-run variance is improved
from the current one by the variance threshold, a new Rx queue to PMD
assignment will be performed.

For example, to set the variance improvement threshold to 40%::

    $ ovs-vsctl set open_vswitch .\
        other_config:pmd-auto-lb-improvement-threshold="40"

If not set, the default variance improvement threshold is 25%.

.. note::

    PMD Auto Load Balancing will not operate if Rx queues are assigned to PMD
    cores on a different NUMA. This is because the processing load could change
    after a new assignment due to differing cross-NUMA datapaths, making it
    difficult to estimate the loads during a dry-run. The only exception is
    when all PMD threads are running on cores from a single NUMA node. In this
    case cross-NUMA datapaths will not change after reassignment.

The minimum time between 2 consecutive PMD auto load balancing iterations can
also be configured by::

    $ ovs-vsctl set open_vswitch .\
        other_config:pmd-auto-lb-rebal-interval="<interval>"

where ``<interval>`` is a value in minutes. The default interval is 1 minute.

A user can use this option to set a minimum frequency of Rx queue to PMD
reassignment due to PMD Auto Load Balance. For example, this could be set
(in min) such that a reassignment is triggered at most every few hours.
